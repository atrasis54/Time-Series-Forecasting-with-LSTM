# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview
This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time-series forecasting. It's applicable for forecasting demand, sales, or stock prices.

## Objectives:
- Forecast future sales for stores using LSTM.
- Predict sales data over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- LSTM
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Key Insights
- Applied LSTM networks to forecast time-series data with good accuracy.
- Trained the model on historical data to predict future values.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to forecast time-series data.
